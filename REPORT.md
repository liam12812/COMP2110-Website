Instructions:
Your team should write a short report on your experience working on this project. There is no hard word limit but as a guide you should be writing around 2000-3000 words. It should cover the following topics:

1. Details of your deployment and where your application can be accessed (URL).
    Our website has been deployed as a static site using Cloudflare pages. We have done so through the use of the wrangler command line tool from Cloudflare which returned the URL https://c784228e.comp2110-group48-portal-2qe.pages.dev at which our website can be accessed. In order to update the website once deployed, all edits have to be committed and pushed to the GitHub repository before running the command “npx wrangler pages deploy .” in the git bash terminal. This means that it deploys the current directory to the site. You can check when the website was last updated from the Cloudflare dashboard, under “workers and pages”. The small differences we made to the website before deploying were that we incorporated a geolocation function to source the latitude and longitude of the user, so that our widgets would work with the current location instead of an input one.

2. What you achieved: a short (few paragraphs) description of what your group has implemented; highlight any extensions or additional work you did.

   Our COMP2110 Portal has been a dedicated group effort to create a portal that is easy to use and navigate, aesthetically pleasing and modern in design. The main website is modular in design, using grid layouts to make up the main shape of the page, and in doing so allowing for simple yet responsive web design when it comes to different screen layouts and sizes. By using blocks for different sections, it is simple to move them around on screen in a logical manner so that information is displayed as needed at different screen sizes and is differentiated by separated blocks. This format allows for easy navigation and a clear, uncluttered user experience, which was an important factor when considering the overall layout and design of the webpage. 
   Another important feature that we have implemented is the ability to either correctly login to the groups blog page or be warned about inputting the incorrect username and/or password, as it is important to provide feedback to the user when an error has occurred. By providing feedback the user knows the mistake they made and can then fix it, which is important in this case as logging in provides access to posting blogs. We have decided to let someone unlogged in view the posts, as they aren't private, but if the application was different that could have been a necessary addition.
   Refresh buttons have been implemented on the blog post and blog creation block to refresh the blocks themselves, rather than the entire webpage, which creates a faster responding website.
   The widgets have been split into two separate bars, where the general information that’s useful on a daily basis such as the weather widget is always displayed at the top, next to the login widget as that is information that a user may want to access by itself when accessing the page, so it is important that is displayed first in order to provide a need to use the portal and simplicity, as less time to access more useful information is an important design factor.





 Developmental Challenges

    Throughout the development stage of this project, there was a limited number of technical and organisational challenges that were encountered. The main technical challenge encountered was that the widgets were not appropriately designed to be responsive. This resulted in the widgets overlapping with one another when resizing the window. The challenge was successfuly overcome by restricting the sizes of every widget to fit within its own designated container regardless of the window size to ensure a responsive design. Another challenge that was encountered by the group was in relation to the availabilities of all group members. It was very difficult to organise a day where all the group members would schedule an online or in-person meeting to discuss the project development plans and work together due to the varying availabilities of each member.This was very challenging during the early stages of the project, however the group collectively decided to detail all the plans moving forward in a discord chat which ensured an optimal level of communication and co-ordination.

Benefits For Learning:
    This project required working with several different APIs with different purposes, this gave us a comprehensive understanding of the use and use cases of APIs. A technical challenge that we faced during this project was that the HTML code for the widgets needed to be inputted as a text string in the .js file for that widget, which meant that we needed to understand how the code works instead of simply being able to rely on the autofill and syntax indicators of the editor that we were using to get all our code right for us. Additionally, this project required us to demonstrate, and therefore to have, an understanding of JavaScript, CSS, web components, APIs, responsive web design, accessibility and User centralised design. all of which were part of the content of this unit.

 Andrew: The Currency Conversion Widget

    - I chose to do the currency conversions widget, because I liked the idea of peforming calculations with the data retrieved using the fetch command. as it turned out, no calculations were required, but that is why I chose to do it.
    - I think the hardest part was finding time to work on it together, because I didn't want to work too late in the evenings, and everyone else was usually busy during the day.

Felix: The Sunrise/set Widget
    
    Whilst there was a wide variety of interesting and useful widgets to select from, I chose a widget that displays different information about sun position over the course of the current day. This is vital to the blog user as it may help them plan their day, and gives the information consisely and at a glance. I chose this as my widget as it relates to the weather widget that liam was doing, creating a more connected feel to the widgets on the page. I also personally find the information it displays interesting, something people often don't think about but can come in handy when planning your days, as it is important when out and about to know what time the sun will set. Whilst the main data was simple to fetch from the API, the challenge of using location services to determine the users coordinates and include them into the url in order to gain user accurate data interested me in providing a widget that adapted to the users location without any extra input from them. This allows for easy and straight forward usage, which is an important element in any good widget design.One challenging element of the project from my perspective was enabling the resizing of the website onto any display and have all elements useable and presentable at any size. It is a very time consuming process, however having that functionality is well worth it as it allows a user to access the portal from any device. However, this was not as difficult as having location services work to allow me to read the users current coordinates to a variable to use in the URL that I have to send to the API to fetch the data. This was a difficult challenge as getCurrentPosition function works asynchronously, meaning it executes not in order but works in the background whilst other code is running. This is useful as it doesn't hold up the rest of the webpage from loading when it is getting the coordinates, however I think that this aspect was not well documented, or I had missed something previous to this and should have been able to identify that the function was asynchronous. It was difficult to solve as much searching online led to the same explanation as that from mozilla and w3schools, where they always printed the variable rather than storing it anywhere outside the function, which was what I needed to do with it. This took many hours to finally figure out, and frustratingly the answer was quite simple. Instead of storing them inside a variable in the script, I needed to store them on the browser itself in the sessionStorage property, which would allow the script to give them to the webpage, and then grab them once they had been found, which prevented the 'undefined' errors I had come across when previously attempted to store them in a local variable, which was easy to explain as clearly the variable was called before it could be set to the coordinates. Once this issue was sorted out, it was a simple matter of implementing the new sessionStorage variables into my fetch URL to personalise the displayed widget information to the users location.

 Liam: The Weather Widget

    The widget that I chose to work on for this assignment was a weather widget that displayed the current weather conditions of any location sent to the API. The reason I chose this widget is the amount of creative liberty I had to play around with as the API had dozens of separate pieces of data that I could retrieve just by changing the URL a little bit. I eventually decided to combine the values of temperature, date, time, city, weather conditions, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, what temperature it feels like, precipitation chance, and precipitation amount into my widget as a sort of central hub for all the important weather knowledge. However, the real selling point of creating this widget were the Boolean data of isday, which returns a 1 if it is day-time or a 0 if it is night-time, and the value weathercode which refers to the WMO Weather Interpretation Codes which change depending on the type of weather. These 2 values meant that I could customise my widget depending on the time and weather which presented itself as a welcome challenge to me. I started by designing and creating different backgrounds for my widget for different weather conditions, each having a theme of day or night. I set these backgrounds to change in the widget depending on weather conditions and to change theme of day or night depending on the isday Boolean. I then downloaded some weather symbol gifs and removed their backgrounds to insert them into my widget also depending on weather conditions to complete the look of my widget.The most challenging part of the project for me was the amount of problem solving required for each separate part of the website, however I also thoroughly enjoyed this part as it was very rewarding when something worked the way you wanted it to. The bulk of problem solving came from the widgets, both my own, and the provided ones such as blog-block, and login. Each of these widgets came with their own challenges to solve and tweak individual lines of code until they were working properly. One example of a frustrating challenge was when I was trying to load the blog block and it just wasn’t working, until I realised that it was because some groups had posted null values into the blog, stopping it from rendering. A fun challenge of this widget was that we wanted to display all the blog posts but there was simply too many of them, so I came up with the idea to change our widget from being able to display however many blog posts you selected from a dropdown to a page system with the amount of posts on a page now correlating with the dropdown instead of the total amount of posts. I believe this system was the optimal way to handle the blogposts and although quite challenging I am proud of my work here. I also created a new widget which I called blog-post which was intended to create a post to the blog from the website. The post request was a bit of a challenge, but I eventually got it in the end. I also made it so that the user had to be logged in to access this widget as the blog posts had to have a user to post. The most challenging part of my own widget was the location aspect which didn’t work as we were hosting on HTTP which doesn’t support geolocation anymore as it is unsafe. I eventually set some latitudes and longitudes for each capital of Australia and set a dropdown to choose the city. I worked in tandem with Felix for this part and stored them in local storage so that his widget could also use these variables. When deploying the site to HTTPS however, we changed these to use the geolocation as we now could and wanted to test whether we could do it or not.

 Saeed: The Public Holidays Widget

    After a brief scan of the plethora of widget options that were available to choose from, I have decided to work on developing a widget that displays the remaining public holidays of particular countries. I specifically chose this widget because I believed it would be resourceful for the users that log on to our web-application.The widget's ability to display the remaining public holidays for the chosen country option can also aid the users in planning their vacations ahead of time if they are unsure of the date of a particular holiday, which is another reason for why I chose it.Although the widget specifications did not dictate that it must have an option for the users to input the country of their choice if it wasn't amongst the countries being displayed, I thought that would be a very useful thing which aids in promoting the complexity and flexibility of my widget, but unfortunately I was not able to do so as it was a bit challenging for me and I had no time remaining.During the development of my widget, I have encountered a timely problem that resulted in my widget displaying all the public holidays of the chosen country instead of the remaining public holidays. Fortunately, I was able to overcome this challenge by adding a piece of code that filters the previous holidays in my fetch function.Another challenge that I encountered was related to my css, as I noticed that the list of remaining public holidays being displayed was overflowing outside the page and being made not visible if the selected contry had too many remining public holidays. This problem was effectively resolved by amalgamating the css properties of 'max-height:200' and 'overflow-y:auto' to create a logical container ensuring that if the list of remaining public holidays exceeds the maximum height, the user can scroll to view the remaining parts of the list.
