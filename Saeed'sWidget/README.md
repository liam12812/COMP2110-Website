This is Saeed's widget.
My widget is going to be displaying the upcoming Australian public holidays amalgamated with the public holidays of a range of other countries.
My plan is to use the following website: <https://date.nager.at> to identify the variety of public holidays for the different countries of my choice.
I also plan on having the widget contain an array of holidays to be diplayed for the user depending on which country they choose.
My widget is going to have a list of countries , that once chosen , the user will be able to effectively view their upcoming public holidays.
