this is andrew's widget, it will he about: Currency Conversions.
It will be able to take an amount of money in many different supported currencys, and convert it into an amount of money in any other of the suppotred currencys.

I have made a lot of changes without comitting and I think it is about time I comitted it.
I copied some classwork from a few weeks ago as a baseline to work from,
I changed the render, fetch and constructor function, and I added a calculate function.
I have moved the file to the src/components/ folder so that I can test it in the preview of the main document.
