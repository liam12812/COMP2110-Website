This is Felix's widget!
My widget is a Sunrise/Sunset display that tells the user the sunrise and sunset time, and can be given further details such as dawn, dusk when they scroll across using the side buttons. When selecting a city in Liam's weather widget, the user can refresh my sun widget using the button in the top left corner to tell them the sunrise and sunset times in that new city. 

It imports the data from SunriseSunset.io.
