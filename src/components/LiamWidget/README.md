This is Liam's Weather Widget"

The data used in it is the current temperature, Latitude and Logitude, Timezone, Max day temp, Min day temp, Weather code, Feels like, Precipitation Chance, Precipitation Amount, Is day, and DateTime.

I have made it so that the background, weather icon, transparent box, and text all change depending on the Time or type of weather.

The widget doesnt include storms as the API doesnt have the data for them outside of Europe.
